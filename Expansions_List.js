	// You can also add other things as long as they're commented.
	// Like you can talk about your day.
	// I had a nice day.
	// I finally found a way to load config files without requiring the user to put a line in ilvl.html
	// Boy was that a rigmarole!
	// I didn't want the user to edit ilvl.html because it's quite a large file. It's a bit cleaner this way.
	// Couldn't use JS modules because you get a CORS error unless you're using a webserver.
	// In the end, I got the program to load the config files by using javascript to add <script> tags to the page after initially loading.
	// An additional step was required because the files are loaded asynchronously: something like a queue (probably the wrong word).
	// I really don't like javascript.
	// I also heard this really nice song on the radio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxPcBuPnm1g
	// And I listened to the Overlord light novel via Firefox's "Reader" mode.
